# <span style="color:blue">Delaware Valley Region School Atlas</span>

Welcome to the **Delaware Valley Region School Atlas**! This project provides a comprehensive visual representation of schools in the Delaware Valley region, helping users explore the distribution and types of schools in this area.

## Overview

The atlas plots schools on an interactive map, categorized by type and visualized using distinct color-coded markers:  
- **District Public**: ðŸŸ¦ **Blue**  
- **Charter Public**: ðŸŸ© **Green**  
- **Secular Private**: ðŸŸª **Purple**  
- **Religious Private**: ðŸŸ¥ **Red**

This tool is designed to make it easy to identify and understand the geographical distribution of educational institutions.

## Repository Contents
### **Repository Contents**

- **`shapefiles/`**: Contains the GIS shapefiles extracted from the original `county_boundaries.zip` file. These files are used to map the schools in the Delaware Valley region.  
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: Provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the School Atlas project.  
- **`README.md`**: An overview of the project, including usage instructions, setup details, and key features.  
- **`SACJResearch_SchoolAtlas.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook that visualizes the school atlas with detailed maps and analysis.  
- **`county_boundaries.zip`**: The original zip file containing the GIS shapefiles for county boundary data. This data is sourced from [DVRPC Open Data](https://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/6184bc21af7b438bbe051be3a54f3b2f_0/explore?location=40.913077%2C-76.096891%2C5.77).  
- **`poetry.lock`**: Tracks Python dependencies for ensuring consistent development and execution environments.

cd ruc-sacj-research-schoolatlas
``` 

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:

```bash
poetry install
```

3. Run the project by executing the code in SACJResearch-SchoolAtlas.ipynb

## Exporting Atlas to HTML
To improve the presentation of the Jupyter Notebook in a browser, you can export it to an HTML file. This will generate a clean HTML document with only the title, description, and visualization included.

Command to Convert Notebook to HTML:
Run the following command in the terminal:

``` bash
jupyter nbconvert --to html --no-prompt --TemplateExporter.exclude_input=True --TemplateExporter.exclude_output=False SACJResearch_SchoolAtlas.ipynb
```

This command will:

Exclude code cells from the output.
Keep the title, description, and visualization for a clear and professional view.
The resulting HTML file will be generated in the same directory as your notebook.
